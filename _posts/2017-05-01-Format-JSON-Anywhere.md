title: I've created a small app to format JSON anywhere

It is a small windows app working on the background. It does one thing: as soon as you press Alt+ B keys, it will format the JSON in your clipboard for you. It is that simple.


# Story:
I've been on a project that involves querying and comparing data (JSON) from 2 sources.
I was going online to format JSON like 10 times an hour. I said it gotta be a better way. That's how `[Clipboard-JSON-Beautifier](
[Download](https://github.com/dhayhak/Clipboard-JSON-Beautifier)` was born.

## Install it and enjoy it!
Format JSON by just copying it and pressing Alt+B. This will work across app. How awsome is that?! :)
