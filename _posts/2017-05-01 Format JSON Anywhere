Format JSON by just copying it and pressing Alt+B. This will work across app. How awsome is that?! :)

# Story:
I've been on a project that involves querying and comparing data (JSON) from 2 sources.
I was going online to format JSON like 10 times an hour. I said it gotta be a better way. That's how `Clipboard-JSON-Beautifier` was born.

## Install it and enjoy it!
